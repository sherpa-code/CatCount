# CatCount

A pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript single-page application.
---
This app presents two "rooms" in a home, each with clickable areas, that must be search to find all of the cats that might be hidden in places they should not be... before the user is late for work!

This project was motivated by the love of my three cats Butane, Big, and Squeak, and how they love to get themselves trapped where they shouldn't be before I leave for work in the morning so it is always necessary to make sure they are safe while I am away.

This version features 3 cats with accompanying gif images.
The background images were generated using the generative AI 'Stable Diffusion XL' courtesy of https://nightcafe.studio
